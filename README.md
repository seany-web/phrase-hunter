# how-to-play
 A random English Idiom is selected at the start of the game and hidden from the player. The player must guess what the phrase is by entering a single alpha character with each turn. If the guessed character is not in the phrase, the player loses a life. If the player successfully guesses a correct character, the player does not lose a life.
 
The game will end if the player runs out of lives or guesses the phrase correctly.

Good luck!
